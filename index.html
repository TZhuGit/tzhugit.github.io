      Hello there, I am Tony Zhu.  <br>
      
      
    Where do you see yourself in one to three years?
    How does your work fit into the world you want to live in?
    What kinds of projects interest you? (It sometimes helps to list tasks you want to stop doing first.)
    What kinds of people do you want to work with? Who are your dream clients?
    What do you want people to do after visiting your website (e.g., hire you, subscribe to your blog)?
    If someone were telling a potential client about you, what would you want them to say?

    </p>
    <br>

  School Projects<br>
  At Western University, I have always enjoyed participating in the hackathons and capture the flag events with other 
  computer scientists and developers. The excitement of going to one of these events to connect with people with similar interest within the 
  coding world outside of my classes is exilerating. These events have help me not only learn new development tools but also allow me to develop
  new problem solving skills through others or good old trail and error. Many sponsor representatives are extremely helpful and friendly, by talking 
  to them they gave me a eye-opening view on the different niches in the technological industry from the known big developing companies such as Google and Amazon
  to coporate IT consulting powerhouses such as Deloitte and to specialized security hacker firms.<br> <br>
  
  Personal Projects<br>
  The two major coding projects I have been apart of are my Gym Trainer android application and House Mate web application. I've always enjoyed designing and contemplating 
  how I can develop applications to tackle daily inconvinences. I'd remember constantly having to think back during each gym session to what numbers I performed last week, how many reps and what weight did I use. 
  I ended up writing them down on my phone's built in notes application and I figured how hard could it be to design an application to make organizing this data more presentable and user-friendly. And then right away
  at the next hackathon I attended I began learning Android development. Then web application development project came along and I was
  introduced to a bunch of new terminology and developer tools that gave me a new apprication for all the software I used every day.
  I worked with 8 other members on a web application to allow people who live together to tackle common problems in an application management
  tool. The application is designed to monitor and keep track of responsibilities, bills, supply levels and other tasks for each individual within the house.
