  School Projects<br>
  At Western University, I have always enjoyed participating in the hackathons and capture the flag events with other 
  computer scientists and developers. The excitement of going to one of these events to connect with people with similar interest within the 
  coding world outside of my classes is something Iâ€™ve always look forward to. These events have help me not only learn new development tools but also allow me to develop
  new problem solving skills through others or good old trail and error. Many sponsor representatives are extremely helpful and friendly, by talking 
  to them they gave me an eye-opening view on the different niches in the technological industry from the known big developing companies such as Google and Amazon
  to corporate IT consulting powerhouses such as Deloitte and to specialized security hacker firms.<br> <br>
  
  Personal Projects<br>
  The two major coding projects I have been apart of are my web socket based chat room web application and House Mate web application. I've always enjoyed designing and contemplating 
  how I can develop applications to tackle daily inconveniences. My interest into web application development came along and I was
  introduced to a bunch of new terminology and developer tools that gave me a new appreciation for all the software I used every day.
  I worked with 8 other members on a web application to allow people who live together to tackle common problems in an application management
  tool. The application is designed to monitor and keep track of responsibilities, bills, supply levels and other tasks for each individual within the house.
